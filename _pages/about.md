I am a research scientist at [IBM Research](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/) in Cambridge, MA, USA. I received my PhD in [Computer Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) advised by [Brian P. Bailey](http://orchid.cs.illinois.edu/people/bailey/index.html) and co-advised by [Karrie Karahalios](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/kkarahal). My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in designing AI systems to improve user experience and mitigate biases.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
